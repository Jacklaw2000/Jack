                        <h3>Duration</h3>
                        <p>I need 8.5 hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p>
                        <p>Some anecdotal evidence to back up the above. I was very tired one day after sleeping for 7-8 hours for about a week in a row and then I got 8.5 hours that night before getting up at 6am, I then managed to get ready from 6:20 and left the house at about 6:50 for a 3 hour drive and 6 hour work day followed by another 3 hour drive and then a gym session and I was awake and alert the whole time. This shows that 8.5 hours is the right number.</p>
                        <p>I can "catch up" on sleep by sleeping longer after sleeping less one day.</p>

                        <h3>Impacts</h3>
                        <p>Alcohol causes my sleep to be interrupted and of low quality. It is harder to get into deep (REM) sleep after consuming alcohol.</p>
                        <p>Light has a big impact on sleep. If sunrise and sunset are too early and too late respectively then closing the blinds and ensuring darkness is necessary. E.g. on long summer days close the blinds and open the window and on short winter days open the blinds and maybe close the window.</p>
                        <p>Heat affects my sleep in the summer the heating should be off, fan on, windows open, and maybe a cold face cloth too and in winter heating should be on minimal to prevent hoses blocking. Fan off, windows probably closed. Depending on temperatures.</p>
                        <p>Food/Diet is important too. For example I had a reasonable amount of sugar 3 hours before bed and was unable to sleep for at least 3 hours after my usual sleep time.</p>
                        <p>Looking at screens before bed also has an impact on sleep as well.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking reading before bed is a good idea as it essentially lets the brain wind down and process the day in the background before a restful sleep.</p>
