                        <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/protein">Australian Protein</a>
                        There are 9 amino acids that your body cannot make, and they are known as essential amino acids. The human body can’t store protein and will excrete any excess, so the most effective way of meeting your daily protein requirement is to eat small amounts at every meal. Min. 0.8*kg of bodyweight = protein in grams per day. Preferably min.1g/kg but up to 1.6g/kg is good too. 10%-35% daily calories. More than 2*kg body weight = too much. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322825">Medical News Today Article</a>
                        Having Protein about every 3 hours seems to be most optimal as, your muscles continue to produce protein for 2-3 hours after consuming it. around 20-30g each serving is good. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-weight-loss-tips-for-athletes#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6">Healthline Weight Loss</a> </p>
                    <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>

                        Avoid all sugar if possible, free sugars are the devil and should be avoided as such. There are sugars in fruit etc. they're ok just don't eat/drink 15 apples/oranges. 
                        whole carbs are good, refined carbs are the devil.
                        long-chain/wholegrain/whole starches are good.
                        Fibre is king, indigestible but feeds the poop goblins which is good for gut health and avoids you being robbed of a poop, 30g a day preferably more.
                        <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Guidelines%20for%20Americans,grams%20of%20carbs%20a%20day.">MayoClinic Carbs</a>
                        The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that carbohydrates make up 45% to 65% of total daily calories.</p>

                        Fat intake should be reduced as much as reasonably possible. Saturated Fats should be eliminated from diet. Trans fats are not great either but generally not a problem, have less than 5g a day though. unsaturated fats are ok. Monounsaturated are good, they reduce bad LDL cholesterol. Polyunsaturated are good too, they reduce bad LDL cholesterol too, omega 3 and 6 are main types. Have less than 70g of fats a day. 20%-30% daily calories should be fats.</p>
                    <h3>Water</h3>
                    <p>2 Litres of Water a day is recommended however drinking little and often, approximately every 15 minutes can lead to better hydration during the day.
